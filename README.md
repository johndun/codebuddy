# Codebuddy

This project enables ChatGPT to submit terminal commands and edit files locally. The terminal functionality works by piping commands to a tmux session. File editing is accomplished by parsing ChatGPT's responses for keywords, such as OVERWRITE, REPLACE, APPEND, followed by markdown code blocks.

[This blog post](https://cursor.sh/blog/instant-apply) by Cursor is a good overview of the challenges that we face when trying to use current propriety LLMs to edit files.

## Warnings

Automatically executing code generated by an LLM on your local computer is super dangerous. Take precautions to ensure you don't lose your work:

- Make non-local copies of your project.
- Work in a dev git branch and frequently push updates to a remote.
- Honestly, you probably shouldn't use this project on a computer with any content that you care about at all. Work in a temporary cloud environment: AWS Sagemaker, etc., instead.

## Setup

Tmux is used to create a persistent session that the LLM can submit commands to.

The `tree` command is used to include a summary of the project's file structure in the prompt. Depending your OS:

```shell
sudo apt install tree
```

```shell
brew tree
```

Turn off git paging to make it easier for an LLM to execute git commands (e.g, `git branch` or `git log`) on your behalf:

```shell
git config --global core.pager cat
```

We also make use of a python `venv` virtual environment.

You will need to make your OpenAI API key available in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. I've been using a `.env` file along with the `dotenv` package. You can install it with `pip install python-dotenv`. 


## Usage

Run in local gradio:

```shell
python codebuddy/tmux_module.py --python_env path/to/env --project_path path/to/project
```
